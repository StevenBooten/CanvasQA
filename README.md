# CanvasQA
Automated QA Documentation for Canvas Courses.

This has been designed and implimented as apart of my role in the Learning & Teaching team of the AEL group at Griffith University.
This is the first project of this scale that I've ever done so there will definitly be a learning curve.
Documentation supporting the usage of Canvas QA and the documents it creates are still a work in progress and you will start to see this appear in the coming weeks/months.

If you would like to contact me about the project feel free to email me: sl.booten@gmail.com

Here are some screenshots of a generated QA report.
